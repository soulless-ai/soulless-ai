### HELLO.

- Continue to develop in myself the sphere of creating and promoting sites.
- I am interested in materials and knowledge mastered by full stack developers.
- There is also an interest in people who are able to quickly and decisively build their way forward in the areas of programming.
- Java development or the relevance of the language to the production of human needs is not ruled out.
After all, even if JS has the ability and reaches a full-fledged programming language, I think every self-respecting person should have an ace up his sleeve.
- To summarize, I can say that the sphere recommends not to lose your grip and desire to learn.
- Ready to practice and work.

- Relevant offers should not pass by a skilled person.
